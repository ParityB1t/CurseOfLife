Tristan: Why I have I been forsaken so... I do not wish to live any longer, I cannot live any longer!
Tristan: No memorabilia of those that have perished through the years. 
Tristan: The pain! It's everywhere. This sick, sick land. 
Tristan: WHY CAN'T I JUST KILL MYSELF!?!?
Mortisis: Becareful what you wish for...
Tristan: Wha... What are you?
Mortisis: That is of no concern, what is important however is that you know there is a way for you to take your life.
Tristan: I have tried everyway possible, jumping off a bridge, hanging myself, submersing myself in lava! 
Tristan: No matter what I do, I keep coming back to this hell hole. I just can't -
Mortisis: There is a way!
Tristan: Please enlighten me!
Mortisis: In order to escape this eternal limbo you must defeat 3 Demons.
Mortisis: Listen and listen well, for I shall only say this once.
Mortisis: "Only the liquid most sacred and pure, can aid you in your quest for your cure."
Tristan: Wait what is that supposed to mea-
Mortisis: Come back to me once you have defeat one of the demons.
Tristan: (Speaking to himself) Surely you're not considering going ahead with this?
Tristan: (Speaking to himself) What other choice do I have? I can't stay here any longer.
Tristan: "Only the liquid most sacred and pure, can aid you in your quest for your cure."
Tristan: Ok I'll look around to see what I can find.
